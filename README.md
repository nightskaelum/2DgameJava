This repository contains my personal learning project for building a 2D game in Java.
I’m following a YouTube tutorial series that teaches the fundamentals of Java game development, including game loops, rendering, input handling, animations, collision detection, and more.
The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Java while building a functional small game from scratch.



Features Implemented So Far
- Basic game window & rendering
- Game loop (update + draw)
- Player movement
- Smooth animation system
- Sprite loading
     
Technologies Used

Java (JDK 17 or above)
Java Swing / AWT for window and rendering
BufferedImage** for sprites
Custom game loop (`delta` or fixed FPS approach)

How to Run the Game

1. Install Java (JDK 17+ recommended).

2. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git

3. Navigate into the project folder and compile:
   javac src/Main/Main.java
   

4. Run the game:
   java Main.Main

Or open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ/Eclipse and run `Main.java`.


What I’m Learning
- Game timing and FPS
- Managing multiple classes in a larger project
- Drawing and updating sprites
- Animation frame systems
- Collision and tile maps
- Clean architecture for games
- Debugging rendering issues (fun!)
- Game design
- Inclusion of AI technologies

Credits

This project is inspired by a popular Java 2D game tutorial on YouTube which walks through the process step-by-step.
Huge thanks to the creator of that series for making the learning process approachable and fun.
